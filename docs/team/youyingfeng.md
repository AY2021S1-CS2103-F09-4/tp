## Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: GUI forms for all CRUD operations (Pull requests [\#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/81), [\#83](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/83), and [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/159))
  * **What it does:** Allows the user to create new clients and orders, view and update client and order information, and delete existing clients and orders from the application.
  * **Justification:** This feature improves the product significantly because it vastly increases the ease of use for both experienced and new users. New users can use the application immediately without needing to learn a single line of code, while experienced users are given the additional option of using a GUI to perform operations.
  * **Highlights:** This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * **Credits:** GUI layout was made in SceneBuilder.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=youyingfeng)

    ([\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/159))
